# MIDDLEWARE

This directory contains your Application Middleware.
The middleware lets you define custom function to be ran before rendering a page or a group of pages (layouts).

More information about the usage of this directory in the documentation:

https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing#middleware

Middleware is a term used in Node.js and Express to refer to a function that has access to a request object and a response object. In Nuxt.js, middleware is very similar. It’s a server-side rendered function that can be set on any page in the application. This is where we’ll set a lot of our server side code. It has access to both the request and response object and it’s run before the route is rendered.

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**
